# My Personal NeoVim Configuration

Very simple configuration of NeoVim using [RPM](https://github.com/nizamiza/rpm) for plugin management. I use [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as a completion engine without any LSPs. Goal is to have a very clean and editing focused environment.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure that you have installed [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) and [Git](https://http://git-scm.com) on your system. Then, backup your current configuration if you have any:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
```

Clone this repository into your `~/.config` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nizamiza/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
